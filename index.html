				<p>Conversation is going 'round<br>
					People talking 'bout the girl who's come to town<br>
					Lovely lady pretty as can be<br>
					No one knows her name she's just a mystery<br>
					I have seen her maybe once or twice<br>
					One thing I can say thought she's very nice<br>
					She's a lady one I really want to know<br>
					Somehow I've got to let my feeling show</p>
				<p>CHORUS
					She's fresh exciting<br>
					She's so exciting to me<br>
					She's fresh exciting<br>
					She's so inviting to me yeah<br></p>
